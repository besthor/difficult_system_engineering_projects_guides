Let’s install the ufw firewall and setup a few rules on web-01.
BUT FIRST CONNECT TO YOUR WEB-01 SERVER
OPEN YOUR (UBUNTU 20.04 LTS) SANDBOX
RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS

	cd /root
	cd .ssh
	ls
	
//create a shell environment variable that contains information about the new agent instance
	eval $('ssh-agent')
//add the private key file for the "school" SSH key pair to the ssh-agent.	
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/school


PLEASE NOTE:
REPLACE 18.234.168.34 with YOUR OWN IP ADDRESS 
//connect with your server
	ssh ubuntu@18.234.168.34

IF YOU HAVE CONNECTED SUCCESSFULLY
FOLLOWING THE STEPS BELOW:

//Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports: 22 (SSH) 443 (HTTPS SSL) 80 (HTTP)

//To configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) to block all incoming traffic except for TCP ports 22, 443, and 80, you can follow these steps:

STILL ON YOUR WEB SERVER

//Check the status of ufw to make sure it is active by running the following command:

	sudo ufw status

//If ufw is not active, you can enable it by running:

	sudo ufw enable

//Set the default outgoing policy to "allow" to allow all outgoing traffic by running the following command:
	sudo ufw default allow outgoing

//Set the default incoming policy to "deny" to block all incoming traffic by running the following command:

	sudo ufw default deny incoming

//Allow incoming traffic on TCP ports 22, 443, and 80 by running the following commands:

	sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
	
	sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
	
	sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

//Verify that the rules have been added by running the following command:

	sudo ufw show added

//This should show the three TCP ports that were allowed in the previous step.

//Finally, enable ufw by running:

	sudo ufw enable

//Your ufw configuration should now block all incoming traffic except for the TCP ports 22 (SSH), 443 (HTTPS SSL), and 80 (HTTP)

NOW ON YOUR SANDBOX
NOT ON YOUR WEB-SERVER
//Create the respective file name with the right content in the right repository and in the right directory
git add .
git commit -m " Block all incoming traffic but"
git push
CHECK YOUR CODE
